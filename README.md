# Data Analysis with Python


In this course we will learn the basic statistical techniques to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis in a professional way. Data analysis is a broad and multidisciplinary concept. With this course, you will learn to take your first steps in the world of data analysis. It combines both theory and practice.

The course begins by explaining basic concepts about data and its properties. Univariate measures as measures of central tendency and dispersion. And it ends with more advanced applications like regression, correlation, analysis of variance, and other important statistical techniques.

You can review the first lessons that I have published totally free for you and you can evaluate the content of the course in detail.

We use Python Jupyter Notebooks as a technology tool of support. Knowledge of the Python language is desirable, but not essential, since during the course the necessary knowledge to carry out the labs and exercises will be provided.



if you are interested in learning or improving your skills in data analysis, this course is for you.
